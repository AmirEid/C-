1- compile with c++ and flags
2- code should compile with -st=c++98
3- folder per each ex
4- names as required
5- class name in UpperCamelCase, files with classes should have the same
name like the file.
ClassName.hpp ClassName.h ClassName.cpp ClassName.tpp BrickWall standing for
brick wall, inside the header its name will be BrickWall.hpp
6- always messages ends with \n
7- Cannot use namespace directive, which is useful to avoid having to 
specify the namespace everytime I use its classes or functions. 
8- friend keyword cannot be used, because it allows one class to access
the private or protected members of another class.
9- STL Standard template library, it provides many useful features like containers vector list map and algorithms like sorting and searching.
10- No include algorithms which is useful because it has functions like sort() and find().
11- when allocating memory using new, it should be released using delete.
12- Orthodox canonical form: 
a- function to destroy object
b- function to copy an existing object
c- assignment function that ensure when an object assigned to another, it makes sure they are properly copied and it checks if it was self assigned.
d- default constructor that is when an object created without any arguments, it initializes the object to a valid state.
